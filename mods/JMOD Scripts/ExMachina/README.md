# Ex Machina

When you want to play a skyblock game, it's a safe bet that you will make use of Ex Nihilo to allow the creation of materials from nothing.  A lot of other mods seem to cooperate with Ex Nihilo's design, likely because Ex Nihilo was made with those mods in mind.

However, RotaryCraft is not one of the mods Ex Nihilo was designed for.  An addon is needed to allow RotaryCraft and Ex Nihilo to operate together.  To this end, Ex Machina was designed.

Ex Machina has several purposes:

* Provide repairable crooks and hammers.
* Remove higher-end drops from the Ex Nihilo Sifter (such as gold materials and diamonds) and transfer them to the RotaryCraft Centrifuge.
* Allow RotaryCraft grinder and extractor to process sifter/centrifuge ore drops to the machines' native drops.
* Design an alternate method of creating bedrock for the bedrock breaker:

  * Grind obsidian using the grinder to make obsidian dust.
  * Combine obsidian dust and gravel together to make obsidian concrete mix.
  * Use liquefaction machine to moisten the mix into obsidian concrete compound.
  * Cook the obsidian concrete compound in the RotaryCraft blast furnace (at 1200 degrees) to make obsidian concrete blocks.
  * Place the obsidian concrete block in front of the bedrock breaker.
  * When the bedrock breaker breaks the obsidian concrete, it will output bedrock dust.


As balancing is considered, new ideas will surface, but for now, these should allow a more integrated skyblock game with RotaryCraft.
