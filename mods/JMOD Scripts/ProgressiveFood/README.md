# Progressive Food

A basic attempt at a food jmod.  Food is easy enough, but I came across an idea: for every ingredient in a recipe, the hunger satisfied is increased by 1, and for each step in a recipe (recipes that came before), the satiation is increased by 1.  This means that every recipe will have hunger and saturation values that match the amount of effort it took to make the food.

Unfortunately, this jmod doesn't work right now, as there are some things about objects in JavaScript I don't understand, as well as how to make recipes with things you want to keep.
