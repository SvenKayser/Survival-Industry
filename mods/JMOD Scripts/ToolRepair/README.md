# Tool Repair

Tinker's Construct added a lot of features, but it also added an entirely non-vanilla method of tool design.  Among those features, you have the ability to repair tools in your crafting table using their key ingredient, and the permanence of your tools, meaning that when they break, they become useless, rather than just disappearing.

Tool Repair adds these features to vanilla tools, so that you can have the benefit of permanent tools with an easier repair process.
