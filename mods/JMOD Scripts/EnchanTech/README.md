# Enchantment Technology

Some modpacks are designed to be technical in nature.  In such packs, enchantment sticks out like a sore thumb.  Enter _Enchantment Technology,_ where all enchantment takes on the more tech-specific term "modification;"  In order to maintain consistency, the enchantment table has been reskinned, complete with a green holographic book, and renamed the "modification table."  All strings (in en_US) have had the word "enchant" replaced with "modify," and the recipe has been altered to fit the more technical theme.

Additionally, this mod will also make appropriate alterations to Enchantment Plus recipes, skins and language as well.
