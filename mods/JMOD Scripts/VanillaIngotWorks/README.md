# Mod Alter

JMOD includes interfaces to tweak recipes for various machines, and the list of machines is
growing.  This jmod is designed to focus on those interfaces in order to better integrate various mods with one another.

Currently, the only recipes being customized are the ones for the RotaryCraft Blast Furnace; it includes recipes for some common alloys (bronze, electrum) as well as all the EnderIO materials.  Keep your eyes peeled for more custom recipes.
